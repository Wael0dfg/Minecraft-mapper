Minecraft worlds are complex, data-rich environments that serve as the foundation for player creativity, exploration, and interaction within the game. These worlds are stored in different formats depending on the edition of Minecraft being used — **Java Edition** and **Bedrock Edition** — each with its own unique file structure, data encoding, and world-saving mechanisms. In **Java Edition**, the world files are typically stored in a folder named after the world, containing subfolders such as `region`, `playerdata`, `entities`, and files like `level.dat` which holds critical metadata including game rules, spawn point, and world generation settings. The terrain and block data are saved using the **Anvil file format**, which organizes the world into `.mca` (chunk array) files located inside the `region` folder, with each file representing a 32x32 chunk area. Each chunk contains detailed information about blocks, entities, tile entities, and biome data in **NBT (Named Binary Tag)** format, a structured binary format ideal for storing hierarchical data. On the other hand, **Bedrock Edition** uses a completely different storage mechanism known as the **SQLite-based world format**, where much of the world data is stored in a single `db` folder containing an `leveldb` or more recently a `world_storage` directory with LevelDB databases that manage chunks, entities, and game state. Unlike Java's region files, Bedrock’s system stores chunks in a key-value database, making direct access and manipulation more challenging without specific tools. Despite these differences, both editions aim to represent the same core gameplay experience, but the underlying technical implementations affect how modders, map developers, and third-party tools interact with world data. Understanding these formats is crucial for creating tools like map viewers, converters, or editors that can parse and visualize Minecraft worlds accurately across platforms.
